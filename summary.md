# Summary
This 8 bit computer processor is a standard scaled-down processor meant to host a unique Instuction Set Architecture. The processor is designed to host a von-neumann register memory ISA but is meant to be configurable depending on the processor's application. The 8 bit processor will be connected to a microcontroller to interface with the program memory to allow for rapid programming and the microcontroller will perform as a code assembler that takes pseudocode input and converts it into assembly code to be run on the processor.
