#Project Overview
This 8 bit computer processor is a standard scaled-down processor meant to host a unique Instuction Set Architecture. The processor is designed to host a von-neumann register memory ISA but is meant to be configurable depending on the processor's application. The 8 bit processor will be connected to a microcontroller to interface with the program memory to allow for rapid programming and the microcontroller will perform as a code assembler that takes pseudocode input and converts it into assembly code to be run on the processor.

#Educational Value Added:
This project will broaden my experience building with computer hardware and will push the boundaries of my knowledge of ISA design. In return, the project will serve as an example of a unique application of a microcontroller used to interface with a basic processor.

#Tasks and Design Decisions
Determine the number of chips required to implement my schematic.

Need a programmable EEPROM

Need additional Octal D type latches to serve as registers

Implement the schematic onto breadboards

Translate logic connections into chip connections

Build/Cut wires to length and plan the physical organization of the boards to maximize space efficiency

Build the circuit in sections (Function Unit, Program Clock, Program Counter, Data Memory, Registers, Program Memory, Bus, Control Lines

Learn more about higher level processor components such as arbitors and perpheral controllers and implement them into the processor

Test the processor section by section to ensure performance

Run test programs and collect output data

compare to predicted output

Connect microcontroller to program memory and write code for assembler

#Design Misc.
#Parts
I have brought the majority of the parts I will need to complete the processor. I still need to purchase:

EEPROM (without read/write timing cycles)

Octal D-Type Latches (Registers)

#BOM + Component costs
I will list the chips I own at a later date

Need:
EEPROM

Registers

#Timeline
Processor will be completed by the end of the semester.
